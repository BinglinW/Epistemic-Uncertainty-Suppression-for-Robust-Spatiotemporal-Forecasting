# Epistemic-Uncertainty-Suppression-for-Robust-Spatiotemporal-Forecasting
This repository contains the source code for the spatiotemporal surrogate model (CAST) developed for robust forecasting in aerospace systems. The code will be made publicly available to support further research and development in the field of digital airworthiness validation and spatiotemporal forecasting. The repository will be open-sourced following the successful submission and acceptance of the related manuscript. Contributions to the project are welcome.
